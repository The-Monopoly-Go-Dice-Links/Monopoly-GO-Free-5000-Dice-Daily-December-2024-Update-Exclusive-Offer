### Why Are Dice So Important in Monopoly GO?

In Monopoly GO, the dice rolls are essential for progressing through the game. Every time you roll, you land on different properties or spaces that give you opportunities to purchase new assets, collect rent, or even face challenges that could impact your game strategy. The more dice rolls you have, the faster you can advance in the game and improve your overall position.

Here are a few reasons why dice are so important in Monopoly GO:
